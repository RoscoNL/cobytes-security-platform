# WordPress Scan Test Report

## Test Execution Summary

I attempted to test creating a WordPress scan on the Cobytes Security Platform. Here's what happened:

### 1. Platform Access
- **URL**: http://localhost:3002
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully accessed landing page

### 2. Login Process
- **Login Page**: ✅ Successfully navigated to login page
- **Credentials Used**: 
  - Email: user@cobytes.com
  - Password: pass
- **Login Result**: ❌ Failed - "Resource not found" error displayed

### 3. Console Errors Detected

The following errors were captured in the browser console:

1. **404 Errors**: 
   - Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
   - This error appeared multiple times

2. **API Errors**:
   - "Failed to load scan types" - The frontend couldn't fetch available scan types from the backend
   - "Auth error" - Authentication appears to be failing

### 4. Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Problem**: The login process doesn't seem to be working correctly. After submitting credentials, the user remains on the login page with an error message.

2. **Missing API Endpoints**: The frontend is trying to access endpoints that return 404 errors, suggesting:
   - The backend API routes may not be properly configured
   - The frontend may be using incorrect API URLs
   - There might be a mismatch between frontend expectations and backend implementation

3. **No CORS Errors**: Interestingly, no CORS errors were detected, which suggests the CORS configuration is working properly.

### 5. Screenshots Captured

The following screenshots were saved in the `screenshots/` directory:
- `01-landing-page.png` - Shows the initial landing page
- `02-login-page.png` - Shows the login form
- `03-login-filled.png` - Shows the login form with credentials entered
- `04-after-login.png` - Shows the error state after login attempt
- `05-new-scan-page.png` - Shows a blank page when trying to access /scans/new

### 6. Root Cause Analysis

The main issues preventing the WordPress scan test are:

1. **Authentication Failure**: The login endpoint appears to be returning a 404 error, preventing user authentication
2. **Missing API Routes**: Critical API endpoints like scan types are not accessible
3. **Frontend-Backend Disconnect**: There seems to be a mismatch between what the frontend expects and what the backend provides

### 7. Recommendations

To fix these issues:

1. Check if the backend server is running properly and all routes are registered
2. Verify the API endpoints match between frontend and backend
3. Ensure the user account exists in the database
4. Check backend logs for more detailed error information
5. Verify the authentication middleware is properly configured

## Conclusion

The WordPress scan could not be tested due to authentication and API connectivity issues. The platform needs debugging to resolve the backend API problems before scan functionality can be tested.
