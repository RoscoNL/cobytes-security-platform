## ‚ö†Ô∏è Production Deployment - REQUIRES MANUAL STEPS

### Current Status
- **API**: ‚úÖ Running at https://securityscan.cobytes.com/api/health
- **Frontend**: ‚ùå Shows company website instead of platform
- **Database**: ‚ùì Needs verification

### Required Actions

#### 1. Deploy via DigitalOcean Dashboard
Since the DigitalOcean CLI requires authentication, you need to deploy manually:

1. Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/93a8fcec-94b3-4c24-9c7f-3b23c6b37b5c
2. Click "Deploy" to trigger deployment from GitHub
3. Monitor the deployment in the Activity tab

#### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in the DigitalOcean dashboard:
```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://doadmin:[PASSWORD]@private-db-securityscan-ams3-do-user-170668-0.k.db.ondigitalocean.com:25060/defaultdb?sslmode=require
JWT_SECRET = [SECURE_SECRET]
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = [DIFFERENT_SECURE_SECRET]
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 3001
PENTEST_TOOLS_API_KEY = 43cIriuvQ9qEeFFaYbFDKpfzwLWuUA92tq7sOpzJ046a87e7
CORS_ORIGIN = https://securityscan.cobytes.com
USE_MOCK_SCANNER = false (for production)
```

#### 3. Alternative: Deploy to VPS using Ansible
If DigitalOcean App Platform is not working:
```bash
cd ansible
# Update inventory.yml with your VPS IP
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

## üìã Production Test Script Ready

A comprehensive production test script is available at:
```
test-everything-production.js
```

Run it after deployment to verify all features work in production:
```bash
node test-everything-production.js
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Run production tests** to verify deployment
3. **Monitor logs** for any issues
4. **Configure DNS** if needed (ensure securityscan.cobytes.com points to the app)

## üìä Code Quality

All code has been:
- ‚úÖ Tested comprehensively
- ‚úÖ Fixed for all navigation and form issues
- ‚úÖ Committed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

The platform is fully functional locally and ready for production deployment!
