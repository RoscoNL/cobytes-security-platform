# WordPress Scan Test Summary

## Test Date: June 8, 2025

### Test Results

1. **Platform Access**: ✅ Success
   - Successfully accessed http://localhost:3002
   - Landing page loads correctly

2. **Login Page**: ✅ Success
   - Successfully navigated to login page
   - Login form displays correctly

3. **Authentication**: ❌ Failed
   - Login attempt failed with "Resource not found" error
   - The frontend is making requests to `/auth/login` instead of `/api/auth/login`
   - Manual API test confirms `/api/auth/login` endpoint works correctly

4. **Console Errors Found**:
   - Multiple 404 errors for missing API endpoints
   - "Failed to load scan types" error
   - Authentication errors

### Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is a **frontend routing/proxy configuration problem**:

1. The backend API is correctly configured at `/api/auth/login`
2. The frontend code appears to be correctly using the `/api` prefix
3. However, the actual HTTP requests are being made to `/auth/login` without the `/api` prefix

This suggests there might be:
- A proxy configuration issue in the frontend Docker container
- An incorrect base URL configuration
- A build-time vs runtime environment variable issue

### Recommendations to Fix

1. **Check Frontend Proxy Configuration**: 
   - Review if there's a `setupProxy.js` or proxy configuration in `package.json`
   - Ensure the proxy is correctly forwarding `/api` requests to the backend

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Check that `REACT_APP_API_URL` is correctly set in the Docker container
   - Ensure it's available at build time (React apps need env vars at build time)

3. **Update Docker Compose**:
   - Add explicit environment variables for the frontend service
   - Ensure the API URL points to the correct backend service

4. **Test Direct API Access**:
   - The backend authentication works correctly when accessed directly
   - User credentials (user@cobytes.com / pass) are valid

### Conclusion

The WordPress scan functionality could not be tested due to authentication issues caused by incorrect API routing in the frontend. The backend is functioning correctly, but the frontend needs configuration fixes to properly communicate with the backend API endpoints.
